# Estimating Residential Solar Potential From Satellite Images

## Overview 🌍
This project employs cutting-edge satellite imagery and machine learning techniques to accurately estimate the solar potential of residential rooftops. By analyzing rooftop orientations, it provides invaluable insights into the feasibility of solar panel installations in residential areas.

## Key Features 🌟
- **Advanced Analysis**: Utilizes the comprehensive DeepRoof dataset for in-depth rooftop analysis.
- **Rooftop Segmentation**: Employs the state-of-the-art SegFormer model for precise rooftop segmentation.
- **Solar Energy Estimation**: Estimates potential solar energy generation based on the specific orientation of rooftops.

## Getting Started 🚀
Follow these simple steps to dive into the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Enes-Yaman/Estimating-Residental-Solar-Potential-From-Satellite-Images.git
   cd Estimating-Residental-Solar-Potential-From-Satellite-Images
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run Inference**:
   - Modify paths in the `inference.py` script to suit your dataset.
   - Process your images:
     ```bash
     python inference.py
     ```

## Future Work 🔮
