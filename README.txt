# DeepRoof Semantic Segmentation

## Overview
This Python script is designed for preprocessing and creating semantic segmentation masks for the DeepRoof dataset. The DeepRoof dataset aims to estimate the solar energy potential of residential properties using satellite imagery. The script utilizes VIA (VGG Image Annotator) annotations to generate segmentation maps for building structures and directions.

## Requirements
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
